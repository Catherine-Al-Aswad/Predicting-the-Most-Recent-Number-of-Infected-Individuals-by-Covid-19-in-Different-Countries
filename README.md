# Predicting-the-Most-Recent-Number-of-Infected-Individuals-by-Covid-19-in-Different-Countries
This study aims to predict the most recent cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in different countries, per 10,000 individuals (on the 23rd of October 2020), using the past government responses in these countries to the outbreak (set on the 15th of June 2020), with some other World Bank indicators of interest. This study builds upon the findings of my previous research by considering a nonlinear model. 

This is a group project done by myself (Catherine Al Aswad), in addition to Ali Alhakeem, Uyen Dao, and Long Kim Long. 

All R code done by Catherine Al Aswad.
